				My fascination with coding began at the age of 14 when I delved into
				small snippets of code using C and C++. Even back then, I couldn't
				resist my nerdy tendencies, so I persuaded my high school to incorporate
				coding into the ICT curriculum, foreseeing its importance in the "new
				future."
			</p>
			<p>
				However, despite my initial enthusiasm, I struggled to find a structured
				approach to coding. I often became demotivated and found myself
				thinking, "I'll learn it someday, just not right now." Life has a way of
				throwing such obstacles our way. Consequently, I ended up pursuing a
				degree in English Studies (also referred to as English Language,
				Linguistics, and Literature). The only connection it had with coding was
				the occasional usage of terms like "Semantics," "Syntax," or discussions
				about tree structures for the DOM.
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet, as my final year of university approached, the desire to fulfil my
				coding aspirations still burned within me. I dabbled in Udemy courses,
				which provided some understanding of coding concepts. However, adult
				responsibilities made it challenging to allocate sufficient time for
				dedicated study.
			</p>
			<p>
				Then, after months of diligent effort, I stumbled upon Northcodersâ€”a
				comprehensive 13-week Full-Stack Bootcamp. It was exactly what I needed:
				a well-structured program that offered dedicated time and space for my
				studies. Now, having completed the program, I can confidently say that
				it has been the most gratifying experience of my life. No longer do I
				yearn to code; I have acquired the necessary skills and can undertake my
				own small projects.{' '}
			</p>
			<p>
				Yet, my journey through education has taught me that coding is not a
				one-time learning endeavour; it requires continuous practice and
				development. Hence, I have decided to create this portfolio as a kind of
				diary to document my coding adventures and track my progress along the
				way.
